If–else in Flask is used to handle different conditions and return responses based on user input or logic.

Useful in form handling, validation, routing decisions, and dynamic content rendering.

if request.method == "POST" helps control behavior based on HTTP methods.

Conditions inside routes decide what message, data, or template to return.

Works seamlessly with Jinja2 templates using {% if %} blocks.

Helps create interactive, user-driven Flask applications.
